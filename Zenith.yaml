  Our project is a speed typing game with two captivating game modes: the 
  standard mode and a math mode. Given a random prompt, type out the given 
  prompt following a series of random typing rules. The time begins the 
  moment the prompt is given and ends when you finish typing so type fast! 
  The less time you take, the more points you're awarded. Be careful 
  though, because if you mistype a character, you will be deducted points.
