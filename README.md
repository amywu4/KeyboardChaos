# Keyboard Chaos
Keyboard Chaos is a speed typing game with two captivating game modes: the standard mode and a math mode. Given a random prompt, type out the given prompt following a series of random typing rules. The time begins the moment the prompt is given and ends when you finish typing so type fast! The less time you take, the more points you're awarded. Be careful though, because if you mistype a character, you will be deducted points.
