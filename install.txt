There are 5 overall steps to install and play our game. You can find them below.
Enjoy!

1. Please follow the instructions below to download OCaml to your Laptop (A-D).
If you already have OCaml installed, please skip to step 2.

A. Unix Development Environment
Linux

If you’re already running Linux, you’re done with this step. Proceed to Install 
OPAM, below.

Mac

Beneath the surface, macOS is already a Unix-based OS. But you’re going to need 
some developer tools and a Unix package manager. There are two to pick from: 
Homebrew and MacPorts. From the perspective of this textbook and CS 3110, it 
doesn’t matter which you choose:

If you’re already accustomed to one, feel free to keep using it. Make sure to 
run its update command before continuing with these instructions.
Otherwise, pick one and follow the installation instructions on its website. 
The installation process for Homebrew is typically easier and faster, which 
might nudge you in that direction. If you do choose MacPorts, make sure to 
follow all the detailed instructions on its page, including XCode and an X11 
server. Do not install both Homebrew and MacPorts; they aren’t meant to 
co-exist. If you change your mind later, make sure to uninstall one before
 installing the other. After you’ve finished installing/updating either 
 Homebrew or MacPorts, proceed to Install OPAM, below.

Windows

Unix development in Windows is made possible by the Windows Subsystem for Linux 
(WSL). If you have a recent version of Windows (build 20262, released 
November 2020, or newer), WSL is easy to install. If you don’t have that recent 
of a version, try running Windows Update to get it.

B. Install OPAM

Linux

Follow the instructions for your distribution 
(https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)

Mac
If you're using Homebrew, run this command:
brew install opam

If you're using MacPorts, run this command:
sudo port install opam

Windows
Run this command from Ubuntu:
sudo apt install opam

C. Initialize OPAM
Linux, Mac, and WSL2. Run:
opam init --bare -a -y

WSL1. Run:
opam init --bare -a -y --disable-sandboxing

D. Create an OPAM Switch

Create a switch by running this command:
opam switch create cs3110-2023sp ocaml-base-compiler.4.14.0

Then in the next step write:
eval $(opam env)

Close your terminal and reopen it. Then run the following:
opam switch list

Continue by installing the OPAM package we need:
opam install -y utop odoc ounit2 qcheck bisect_ppx menhir ocaml-lsp-server ocamlformat ocamlformat-rpc

E. Install ANSITerminal

Run the following command into your terminal:
opam install ANSITerminal

2. Navigate to the root directory zenith.

3. Then type the command "make play" in the terminal.

4. You have two gamemodes you can play. Either type "standard" or "math" when prompted to do so.

5. From there, follow the in game instructions and enjoy!
